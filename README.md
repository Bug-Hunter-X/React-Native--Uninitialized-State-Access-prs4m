This repository demonstrates a common React Native bug: accessing state before it has been initialized. The bug occurs when trying to access a state variable before the asynchronous operation (e.g., data fetching) that updates it has completed. This leads to unexpected behavior, often rendering undefined or null values and causing application crashes. The solution demonstrates a way to solve this using a combination of conditional rendering and setting a loading state.
